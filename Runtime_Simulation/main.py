import models

#STEP 1: Import raw voltage values from v3_Data.csv and get average of v3 and v0 cells
#STEP 2: Filter them same as what we did in v3_power_plot to get 2 voltage traces
#STEP 3:
# For each day:
#   on_MSP430, on_Ambiq, on_MARS = 0
#   For each time step (like every 60 s given our logging freq):
#       - Update the energy in our capacitor (put fcn in models.py) given (1) input voltage, (2) time step, (3) capacitance (prob 10 uF), this will be an integral
#       - Check if energy is enough to turn on (1) 1 uJ load, (2) 10 uJ load, and (3) 20 uJ load (will tweak later to reflect real energy cost of each system)
#       - If so, add to on_MSP430, on_Ambiq, and on_MARS and reset capacitor energy to 0 J (might tweak this value)
#   Append on_MSP430, on_Ambiq, on_MARS to on_MSP430_list, on_Ambiq_list, on_MARS_list. This will be a list of how many sensor readings we are able to take with each of these systems every day given the energy we got
#STEP 4: Visualize the daily # of readings with 3 bar graphs, y axis is # of readings and x axis is days.
#   - Given 3 lists of integer values, plot them on bar graphs
